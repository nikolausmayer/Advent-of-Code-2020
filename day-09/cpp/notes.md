Finally, a problem for an actual *a l g o r i t h m*! 
Part 1 was again very simple, and a naive nested-loop was plenty fast enough.
Part 2 is a completely vanilla instance of a common "coding-interview"-style question, though the nested-loop approach would probably work fine as well, considering how the input list is only 1000 elements long (and computers are *fast*).
