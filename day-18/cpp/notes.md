I think I made part 2 of this day unnecessarily difficult for myself by using a too-simple approach for part 1. Had I built a recursive tree of custom operators, I imagine part 2 could have been trivial. Instead, I had to rework the entire solution approach to account for the new operator precedence rules.
Still, not a *difficult* day, just a lot of work.
