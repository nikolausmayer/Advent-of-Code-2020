Another very easy day. This one reminded me of last year, when I wrote my solutions in Shellscript --- this day would have been hardly more difficult in bash than in a real language!
On the one hand, I am a little disappointed that brute-forcing worked *again*. On the other hand, it's nice to not spend hours on a day.
I played with the idea of pre-computing a map of seat visibilities for part 2, but scrapped it because the task is really not computationally complex enough for a decent payoff for the added implementation effort.
