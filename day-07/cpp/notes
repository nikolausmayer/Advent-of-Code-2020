Finally, this year's first instance of the dreaded "parse graphs until you drop"-type problem! Luckily, this one is still simple enough to not have to worry about algorithmic complexity.

Today I learned:
- Loading `std::istream::operator>>` into a `std::string` captures punctuation, such as the "." in "bags.".
- I need to work on my understanding (or rather, lack thereof) of `std::string_view`.
- Ranges are *awesome*.
