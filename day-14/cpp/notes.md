Another simple day (though it was not *easy* for me). I stumbled (twice!) over `1 << 35` not yielding the expected result in C++ --- the reason being that GCC sets the `1` to `int` by default, which is a 32-bit type. Of course, a 35-bit shift does not agree with this and I needed to use `1ul << 35`. Interestingly, GCC warned be the first time I wrote the bug, but not the second time.
