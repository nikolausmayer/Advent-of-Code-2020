Be careful what you wish for, I guess. This day was *difficult*.
Part 1 was easy, no issues here. In classic AoC fashion, part 2 hit hard. I was lucky to notice early on that all busses have prime periods, which made going through the first example on paper a lot easier. Just like with the previous days, I attempted to find an incremental method that would precompute the constraints for the first two busses and then continue factoring in one bus at a time.
I am almost certain that I have not found the "correct" algorithm. The problem **smells** like there should be a far more elegant solution than mine, but at least I can guarantee fast runtime (strictly bound maximum iterations) and that no intermediate result will be larger than the end result (which helps with data types).
