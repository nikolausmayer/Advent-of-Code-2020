This day was classic Advent of Code goodness. Lots of potential for finding the right data structures and small algorithmic improvements here. I'm sure my solution is nowhere close to optimal (it is too slow for that), but at least its speed does not decrease *very* much over time. I learned that I need to read into what the different `std::??list` types do and where to properly use them.
