I got lucky with this day, I think.
Part 1 is easy and very fast; almost too easy.
The text for part 2 already indicates that brute-forcing won't cut it. I am proud of what little coding-interview training I did, because *I could actually apply it* here --- the key idea of computing and re-using partial results is something that comes up in interview questions all the time. I'm not sure what to call this thing, but it feels like a "selective Fibonacci" problem --- sum up a subset of the previous N results.
